### About Me  

As a developer, I focus on building robust, efficient, and maintainable software solutions. My approach combines strong problem-solving skills with a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and agile methodologies. I‚Äôm experienced in working collaboratively in team environments, leveraging tools like GitHub, Scrum boards, and project management frameworks to deliver results effectively.

Some of my key strengths include:
- **Algorithm Design**: Developing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems, including graph-based and optimization challenges.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations and reports using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Gnuplot.
- **System Simulation**: Building simulation systems that model real-world scenarios and provide actionable insights.
- **Software Architecture**: Designing scalable and maintainable systems using OOP principles and clean coding practices.
